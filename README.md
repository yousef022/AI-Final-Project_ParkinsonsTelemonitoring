# AI-Final-Project_ParkinsonsTelemonitoring

Biomedical speech measures from 42 patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease make up the "Parkinson's Telemonitoring" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. A telemonitoring equipment was used in this six-month trial to remotely track the course of the participants' symptoms. The dataset contains information such as subject number, age, gender, time from baseline recruitment, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 biomedical speech measurements. It consists of 5,875 voice recordings that were automatically gathered in the homes of patients. This dataset's main goal is to make it easier to use these speech metrics to predict motor and overall UPDRS scores. Each row in the data is a voice recording, and it is formatted as ASCII CSV. Each patient had about 200 recordings done, with the subject number appearing in the first column for each. The model was built using the Random Forest classifier without any tuning needed. Training the model with 0 folds yielded the best  scores.
